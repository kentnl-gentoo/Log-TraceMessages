	* README, TraceMessages.pm, test.pl: Version 1.4.

2003-12-05 22:35  ed

	* test.pl: After setting $Logfile to undef, an extra call to t() is
	  needed to close the file before it can be unlinked on Windows.

2003-06-21 14:29  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: Uncuddled else as recommended by perlstyle.

2003-06-21 14:28  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: Quoted ' in pod documentation so Emacs
	  font-lock works.

2003-01-26 17:58  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm, test.pl: Version 1.3.  test.pl now has its
	  version number in a variable $VERSION where it can be easily
	  checked to see it matches that in TraceMessages.pm.  The only
	  reason for this release is that the last one had the numbers
	  mismatched!

2003-01-26 17:55  ed

	* mkdist: Use set -e to exit when any command fails (we don't want
	  to start rming things when cd has failed, for example).

	  Changed to use CVS and cvs2cl rather than RCS.

	  Check that the versions in test.pl and TraceMessages.pm match.

2002-10-25 16:05  ed

	* README: Updated for version 1.2.

2002-09-26 21:49  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: Bumped version to 1.2, and moved the assignment
	  onto its own line so CPAN can parse it (hopefully).

2002-09-01 14:57  ed

	* README, TraceMessages.pm: Updated my email address.

2001-11-28 13:21  ed

	* README: Updated for version 1.1.

2001-11-28 13:16  ed

	* Makefile.PL: Added HTML::FromText as a dependency (thanks to
	  cpan-testers for spotting this).

2001-02-12 17:45  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: Reinstated isa(AutoLoader) - otherwise the
	  Makefile goes wrong

2001-02-08 18:30  ed

	* test.pl: Lots of fiddling around trying to make it work after RCS
	  corrupted it; changing variable names to stop that happening
	  again.

2000-11-24 17:50  ed

	* test.pl: Added tests for $Logfile

2000-11-24 17:50  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: Added $Logfile letting you change where
	  messages are printed

2000-10-16 18:36  ed

	* mkdist: Load TraceMessages.pm from current directory to get
	  version (not random one lying around in PERL5LIB)

2000-10-15 18:48  ed

	* mkdist: Works

2000-10-15 18:47  ed

	* MANIFEST: Sort properly - working around locale bug in GNU sort

2000-10-15 18:06  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: d() returns empty string (instead of undef) if
	  trace is off - stops warnings

2000-10-15 17:57  ed

	* test.pl: Test code for t(), d(), check_argv() and $On, $CGI flags

2000-10-15 17:48  ed

	* TraceMessages.pm: Remember to require HTML::FromText before
	  trying to use it

2000-10-15 17:08  ed
