=head1 NAME

Log::TraceMessages - Perl extension for trace messages used in debugging

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::TraceMessages qw(t d);
  $Log::TraceMessages::On = 1;
  t 'got to here';
  t 'value of $a is ' . d($a);
  {
      local $Log::TraceMessages::On = 0;
      t 'this message will not be printed';
  }

  $Log::TraceMessages::Logfile = 'log.out';
  t 'this message will go to the file log.out';
  $Log::TraceMessages::Logfile = undef;
  t 'and this message is on stderr as usual';

  # For a CGI program producing HTML
  $Log::TraceMessages::CGI = 1;

  # Or to turn on trace if there's a command-line argument '--trace'
  Log::TraceMessages::check_argv();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a slightly better way to put trace statements into your
code than just calling print().  It provides an easy way to turn trace
on and off for particular sections of code without having to comment
out bits of source.

=head1 USAGE

=over

=item $Log::TraceMessages::On

Flag controlling whether tracing is on or off.  You can set it as you
wish, and of course it can be C<local>-ized.  The default is off.

=cut
use vars '$On';
$On = 0;

=pod


=item $Log::TraceMessages::Logfile

The name of the file to which trace should be appended.  If this is
undefined (which is the default), then trace will be written to
stderr, or to stdout if C<$CGI> is set.

=cut
use vars '$Logfile';
$Logfile = undef;
my $curr_Logfile = $Logfile;
my $fh = undef;

=pod


=item $Log::TraceMessages::CGI

Flag controlling whether the program printing trace messages is a CGI
program (default is no).  This means that trace messages will be
printed as HTML.  Unless C<$Logfile> is also set, messages will be
printed to stdout so they appear in the output page.

=cut
use vars '$CGI';
$CGI = 0;

=pod


=item t(messages)

Print the given strings, if tracing is enabled.  Unless C<$CGI> is
true or C<$Logfile> is set, each message will be printed to stderr
with a newline appended.

=cut
sub t(@) {
    return unless $On;
    
    if (defined $Logfile) {
	unless (defined $curr_Logfile and $curr_Logfile eq $Logfile) {
	    if (defined $fh) {
		close $fh unless ($fh eq \*STDOUT or $fh eq \*STDERR);
	    }
	    undef $fh;
	}

	if (not defined $fh) {
	    $fh = new FileHandle(">>$Logfile")
	      or die "cannot append to $Logfile: $!";

	    # Autoflushing here is really just a kludge to let the
	    # test suite work.  Although it could be useful for
	    # 'tail -f' etc.
	    # 
	    $fh->autoflush(1);

	    $curr_Logfile = $Logfile;
	}
    }
    else {
	if (defined $fh) {
	    close $fh unless ($fh eq \*STDOUT or $fh eq \*STDERR);
	}
	$fh = $CGI ? \*STDOUT : \*STDERR;
	undef $curr_Logfile;
    }
    die if not defined $fh;

    my $s;
    foreach $s (@_) {
	if ($CGI) {
	    require HTML::FromText;
	    print $fh "\n<pre>", HTML::FromText::text2html($s), "</pre>\n"
	      or die "cannot print to filehandle: $!";
	}
	else {
	    print $fh "$s\n"
	      or die "cannot print to filehandle: $!";
	}
    }
}

=item trace(messages)

Synonym for C<t(messages)>.

=cut
sub trace(@) { &t }

=pod


=item d(scalar)

Return a string representation of a scalar's value suitable for use in
a trace statement.  This is just a wrapper for Data::Dumper.

C<d()> will exit with '' if trace is not turned on.  This is to
stop your program being slowed down by generating lots of strings for
trace statements that are never printed.

=cut
sub d($) {
    return '' if not $On;
    require Data::Dumper;
    my $s = $_[0];
    my $d = Data::Dumper::Dumper($s);
    $d =~ s/^\$VAR1 =\s*//;
    $d =~ s/;$//;
    chomp $d;
    return $d;
}

=pod


=item dmp(scalar)

Synonym for C<d(scalar)>.

=cut
sub dmp(@) { &d }

=pod


=item check_argv()

Looks at the global C<@ARGV> of command-line parameters to find one
called '--trace'.  If this is found, it will be removed from C<@ARGV>
and tracing will be turned on.  Since tracing is off by default,
calling C<check_argv()> is a way to make your program print trace only
when you ask for it from the command line.

=cut
sub check_argv() {
    my @new_argv = ();
    foreach (@ARGV) {
        if ($_ eq '--trace') {
	    $On = 1;
        } else {
	    push @new_argv, $_;
        }
    }
    @ARGV = @new_argv;
}
